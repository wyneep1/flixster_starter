### Reflection

* Did the topics discussed in your labs prepare you to complete the assignment? Be specific, which features in your weekly assignment did you feel unprepared to complete?

    Yes, I feel like the javascript lab, where we created the gif application helped alot with understanding API's because I was completely new to it. I felt like it prepared me enough by equipping me with the basic functions and allowing me to figure out what else to incorporate.

* If you had more time, what would you have done differently? Would you have added additional features? Changed the way your project responded to a particular event, etc.
  
    Yes, if I had more time I would definitely take more time to make it accessible! I really like the idea of a color mode switch so that I can allow for viewers who are color blind, or just tired of seeing color, view the site in a darker mode.


* Reflect on your project demo, what went well? Were there things that maybe didn't go as planned? Did you notice something that your peer did that you would like to try next time?
    Something that went well for me today was being able to demonstrate how all of my functions worked, as well as have some really nice CSS.
    
    One feature I noticed during the project demo that I would love to incorporate in my work is the color switch functionality and the scroll up function! So, next time I would like to try that!
